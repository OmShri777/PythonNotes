    "Classification (a type of supervised learning) helps to identify to which set of categories an observation belongs based on the training data set that contains the observations. The most common Python library used for classification is Scikit-Learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Clustering:\n",
    "Clustering means grouping a set of objects such that the objects in one cluster are more or less similar to each other than ones in the other clusters. Unlike classification, this type of data analysis is a type of unsupervised learning. One of the most popular clustering techniques is K-Means.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Linear Regression:\n",
    "Linear Regression is a type of supervised learning algorithm that will predict the value of a dependent variable (a) based on an independent variable (b). The algorithm calculates the linear relationship between the input and output variables and plots a straight line on the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### How is Python used in Web Scraping?\n",
    "- Scraping means to scrape content from the website.\n",
    "- For scraping purposes, python has Beautifulsoup( as a bs4), requests popular libraries.\n",
    "- Python has a complete framework for Web Scraping: Scrapy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### How is Python used in BlockChain?\n",
    "- Blockchain was initially developed as financial technology, it’s spreading to a variety of other industries as well. Blockchain can be used for almost any kind of transaction like real estate dealings, medical record transfers, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In Python, we can use flask, requests, hashlib, JSON library together to implement a blockchain algorithm and then use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### How is Python used in Hacking?\n",
    "Being able to gain access to a system that you’re not supposed to have access to is known as Hacking. Python is a very simple language yet powerful scripting language, it’s open-source and object-oriented and it has great libraries that can be used for both for hacking and for writing very useful normal programs other than hacking programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### DevOps Using Python\n",
    "DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) with the aim of automating and shortening the systems development life cycle while delivering features, fixes, and updates frequently. Python plays a significant role in DevOps due to its versatility, extensive libraries, and simplicity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tools Required:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ansible\n",
    "- Docker Compose\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Software Testing Using Python\n",
    "Software testing using Python involves the use of Python programming language and various testing frameworks and libraries to assess the quality and functionality of software applications. Python is a versatile language for automating and conducting tests, ranging from unit tests to end-to-end testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tools Required:\n",
    "\n",
    "- doctest\n",
    "- pytest\n",
    "- unitest\n",

    "Like any other language, Python is also not perfect and have some disadvantages. Some of the disadvantages are -\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python is slower than other programming languages like C/C++ and is not closer to hardware like C/C++\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is not a very good language for mobile development\n",
    "\n",
    "- For any memory-intensive tasks Python is not a good choice. That is why it is not used for that purpose. Python’s memory consumption is also high, due to the flexibility of the data types."

    "- Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).\n",
    "- Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.\n",
    "- Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.\n",
    "- Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.\n",
    "- Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Good to know\n",
    "- The most recent major version of Python is Python 3, which we shall be using in this tutorial.\n",
    "- In this tutorial Python will be written in a text editor. It is possible to write Python in an Integrated Development Environment, such as Thonny, Pycharm, Netbeans or Eclipse which are particularly useful when managing larger collections of Python files.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Python Syntax compared to other programming languages\n",
    "- Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.\n",
    "- Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.\n",
    "- Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose."
